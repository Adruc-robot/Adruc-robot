Hello - I'm Daniel Curda. Here are a collection of projects I've put together.

I began my professional career as a chemist and have migrated into IT. I've spent the bulk of the last 13 years working with a laboratory information management system called LabWare. Now I'm looking to get into some aspect of web development. Take a look at my stuff!

Daniel
